# ToDoList
## A To-Do list App
---

**A small web app to create, manage and keep To-do lists.**
**Functions include:**
- Ability to organise several different to-do list
- To do items are customisable and editable
- Simplified interface for ease of use

**Things I want to implement in the future:**
- Priority items and colour coding
- Ordering todo items within a list
- Ability to duplicate lists
- Ability to add an item to several lists
- Alerts for items that have an impending due-date

*A quick note about what this project meant to me:*
This project was created in the 'Object Orientated Programming Principles' section of The Odin Project. While studying those concepts and particularly the SOLID principles I came upon the 'Publish-Subscribe' design pattern which was something I wanted to try to make and implement in a project; not because it was particularly the most intuitive or effective way to do it, but to gain a deeper understanding of how it might work, and how loosely coupled modules look in an web application. 
I have a feeling that mine is a particularly clumsy implementation of this design pattern. At the core the Pub/Sub pattern works well within my application, but I suspect my modules could have been designed better, and I think there are still a lot of elements that break those SOLID principles (when adding or changing certain features, often another feature will stop working). I can see that a more thorough planning stage might have helped here, however when setting out on this project, I wasn't even sure about what kind of things I should be putting into my plan. I think for my next project the knowledge will be there and I can hopefully go about working in a more systematic and efficient way.
The positive outcomes however were many. One surprising thing happened when I had finished the work for adding items to the 'default' to-do list I had set up, and all the functions and methods surrounding the items and started work on adding functionality for other 'projects'. I wrote the function for adding a new list, and added it to the code, and surprisingly, a lot of the features which I expected to have to tweak to work with user-added lists worked right then and there! It was a (sorry to say) exciting moment for me! I was able to add items, edit them and delete them, as well as see the new list appended to my page just after adding it, all thanks to the foundations I had spent a long time setting up (I tried to create them specifically so they could be easily expanded on).
Another positive outcome was my realisation that having completed this, I can simply use the Publish/Subscribe module that I wrote (copied? I tried to tweak it to suit my purposes) on future projects. This was all explained in The Odin Project as the benefit of working with modules, but seeing it and having it reinforces those concepts in my mind.
All in all, although I spent a long time working on this (and the other projects from this course), I can confidently say that it has deepened my understanding of a lot of concepts, even though I feel like I am still scratching the surface.
Furthermore, I feel like this is a project that I will continue to come back to and improve.
